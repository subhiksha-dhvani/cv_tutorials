avgtime = framesPerSec(30,framecount)
insttime = framesPerSec(30,1)
 
 
def framesPerSec(fpsknwn, fpsToFind):
    calfps = fpsToFind/fpsknwn
    return calfps
 
 
Understand and explain the above?
framesPerSec(fpsknwn, fpsToFind) 
Average speed:
I have considered 30 frames in one second, and wanted to calculate for total frames so passed frame count
avgtime = framesPerSec(30,framecount)

for example:
To find seconds for 6 frames
30 frames, one second
6 total frames x seconds

calfps= 6/30  

Instantaneous speed:
I have considered 30 frames in one second, and wanted to calculate for one frame at a time

calfps= 1/30

here callfps is seconds; to use in distance divided by time(seconds)

==========================================================
What will happen if there are two balls?
Only one ball is calculated.
x, y, w, h and current and previous is done for one ball when another ball when another ball is give value is changed to new value, (old value is lost)
===========================================================
# Countour area for each contour
            for j, ci in enumerate(iterable=cntr):
What is the use of this loop
cntr has all outlines 
looping each outline seperately to find ball circle with required threshold area
ci here will have points of the outline circle 


===========================================================
Display output result with units
Both average speed and instantaneous speed will have the unit pixel per second 

because the diffrence between x (current and previous is taken )

===========================================================
Why are you using frame.copy()? - Explain
when there is no countour I want to display my original frame. (used when ball is not available = no contour found )

=============================================================
